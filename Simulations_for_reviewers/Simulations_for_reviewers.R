#This script documents and utilizes code to simulate a random variable with a prticular correlation to a vector of interest
#We use these simulations to show that the bias in age predictions must be 
#accounted for when testing for predictors of epigenetic age acceleration.

#Simcor is main function that takes a variable, x, and simulates a new, random variable with a specified:
#Mean, sd, and correlation to x

simcor <- function (x, ymean=MEAN, ysd=SD, correlation=0) {
  #What a vector of the same length
  n <- length(x)
  
  #Draw from a normal distribution based on specified mean and SD
  y <- rnorm(n,mean = ymean,sd=ysd)
  
  #Take the vector of interest, scaled to mean 0, var 1, rescaled by the correlation
  #Add Randomly distributed noise scaled by 1-correlation
  #Result will be mean 0, var 1 vector
  z <- correlation * scale(x)[,1] + sqrt(1 - correlation^2) * scale(resid(lm(y ~ x)))[,1]
  
  #Rescale by desired sd and add to desired mean
  yresult <- ymean + ysd * z
  return(yresult)

#Here we show that if a variable is correlated with chronological age, like raw BMI is,
#then age bias in delta age must be account for.
#For example,

plot(data$delta_age~data$age,pch=20,xlab="Chronological age (years)",ylab="Delta age")
abline(lm(data$delta_age~data$age),lty=2)

#Here we see the strong age bias in our delta age predictions, such that older individuals tend to be underestimated
#i.e. they tend to have a negative delta age (Predicted-chronological age)

#Since BMI has a strong relationship with age throughout development
plot(data$BMI~data$age,pch=20,xlab="Chronological age (years)",ylab="BMI")

#The age structure in both delta age and BMI produce a correlation

#To show that this is a statistical artifact,
#and not a product of a true relationship between BMI and epigenetic age acceleration:

#We will simulate a random variable 1000 times that has the same mean and variance as BMI, 
#and this variable has the same correlation with age that BMI has with age 

#If these simulated variables predict delta age, despite having no true relationship, this result would suggest the association
#between BMI and delta age is also an artifact of it's correlation with chronological age

#If this simulated variable does not predict delta age, this result would suggest that 
#the association between BMI and delta age is due to a true biological relationship between variance in BMI and epigenetic age

#The correlation between BMI and age in these samples is ~0.6
cor(data$BMI,data$age,use="pairwise.complete.obs")

#Lets simulate one, random variable as outlined above.

par(mfrow=c(1,3),pty="s")
plot(data$age~data$simulated,xlab="Simulated variable",ylab="Chronological age",pch=20)
cor.test(data$simulated,data$age)
#As expected, the simulated variable and age have a correlation of 0.6

#We also see that the simulated variable and delta age are strongly, negatively correlated (as is BMI and delta age)
plot(data$delta_age~data$simulated,xlab="Simulated variable",ylab="Predicted epigenetic age- Chronological age",pch=20)
cor.test(data$simulated,data$delta_age)

#Finally, using residual epigenetic age (delta age controlling for the age bias in predictions by regressing age out from delta age and taking the residuals),
#We find no relationship between the simulated variable and residual epigenetic age

#We will extract the pearson's r correlation between the simulated variable and delta age
#We will extract the pearson's r correlation between the simulated variable and residual epigenetic age
#And we will extract the associated significance in those correlations as well.
