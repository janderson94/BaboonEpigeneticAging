#Requires
#R
#library glmnet
#Version 2.0.10 used for main manuscript results
#Newer versions will give very slightly different epigenetic age predictions (e.g. within a few hundredths). 

#This script builds leave-one-out models designed for parallelizing across samples (SAMP) and alpha values (ALPH).
#Each combination of sample and alpha value becomes it's own R script.
