# Baboon Epigenetic Aging (Anderson and Johnston et al. 2020, _in revision_)

This repository holds the code used to analyze the data from, and recreate the results in, _Anderson and Johnston et al. 2020_ (cite). These scripts include,

  (i) Scripts for trimming, mapping, and filtering reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing data.
  (ii) Parallelizeable scripts for normalizing methylation ratios and building elastic net models through leave-one-out internal cross-validation.
  (iii) Linear modeling of age predictions.
  (iv) Enrichment analysis of clock sites.
